## üåü Overview & Inspiration

**TeeStore** is a modern, responsive e-commerce application specializing in customizable apparel and printing services.

This project was built out of inspiration from my **uncle's apparel manufacturing business**, serving as a fully functional and highly customizable digital storefront. It aims to demonstrate how modern web development can streamline a traditional business, offering users a seamless way to design custom clothing, manage their cart, and, critically, **initiate order processing** through instant communication.
